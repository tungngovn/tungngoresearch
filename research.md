## MedBot

Since Aug 2022, I am the supervisor for the first undergraduate intelligent robot research team at VinUni.

## Automatic cranial implant design with multi-agent reinforcement learning
PI: Dr. Huy-Hieu Pham, Prof. Minh Do
I proposed a solution to use reinforcement learning to refine cranial implant designs for varied real-world cases.

## Light weight Visual SLAM for autonomous vehicles based on GraphSLAM and Deep Learning 
PI: Dr. Xuan-Ha Nguyen
I proposed a new SLAM system that use an object detection model and a stereo depth estimation model for the frontend process. GraphSLAM was used to avoid redundancy and loop-closing. The solution is expected to improve the frontend process in both accuracy and computational effiency.

PI: Dr. Xuan-Ha Nguyen
AIR-HUST is an autonomous intelligent service mobile robot developed by the Autonomous Intelligent Robotics Lab at HUST. I was the leader of the undergraduates in this project.

CBot is an intelligent service mobile robot based on Turtlebot2 at CMC Corporation. I developed the software system of the robot. In this project, I also do research on 2D SLAM for indoor robots.
