## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="TungNgo-ava.jpg">

I am currently a teaching assistant at College of Engineering and Computer Science (CECS), VinUniversity, Vietnam. Before that, I worked as a research assistant at [VinUni-Illinois Smart Health Center (VISHC), VinUniversity](https://smarthealth.vinuni.edu.vn/), supervised by [Prof. Minh Do](https://minhdo.ece.illinois.edu/) from UIUC and [Dr. Huy-Hieu Pham](https://huyhieupham.github.io/). Prior to VinUniversity, I obtained my M.Sc. degree and B.S.E degree (talented program - top 1% university) in Mechatronics Engineering at Hanoi University of Science and Technology under the supervision of [Dr-Ing. Xuan-Ha Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FO_xu-8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

*I am looking for a Ph.D. opportunity to dig deeper into the topic of applying Reinforcement Learning and Computer Vision in active SLAM*.

## Research Interest

My research interest is in autonomous systems such as robots, and vehicles. My research spans from algorithms (**Reinforcement Learning, SLAM, Deep Learning, and Probabilistic Robotics**) to hands-on developing robotic systems (ROS, electrical circuit, and 3D printing).

## News

- Sep, 2022: I started a new role as a teaching assistant for 6 ME courses at College of Engineering and Computer Science, VinUniversity.
- Sep, 2022: I received my MSc degree in Mechatronics at HUST.
- Mar, 2022: I started a new role as a research assistant (RA) at [VinUni-Illinois Smart Health Center (VISHC), VinUniversity](https://smarthealth.vinuni.edu.vn/).
