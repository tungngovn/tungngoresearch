## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="TungNgo-ava.jpg" width="100" height="100">

I am currently a master student in Mechatronics under the supervisor of [Dr-Ing. Nguyen Xuan Ha](https://sme.hust.edu.vn/can-bo/ts-nguyen-xuan-ha.html) at [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://en.hust.edu.vn/home) (HUST).  Prior to that, I graduated from the Talented Program (Degree of Engineer) in Mechatronics at HUST.

## Research Interest

My research interest is in Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous Systems, for example, robots, vehicles, etc. My research spans from algorithms (SLAM, Deep Learning, Probabilistic Robotics) to developing robotic systems.
