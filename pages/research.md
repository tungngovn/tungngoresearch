## ECG 



ECG classification using deep learning and preprocessing techniques such as matrix profile, R-peak analysis

## MedBot

Since Aug 2022, I am the supervisor for the first undergraduate intelligent robot research team at VinUniversity.

## Automatic cranial implant design with multi-agent reinforcement learning
PI: [Dr. Huy-Hieu Pham](https://huyhieupham.github.io/), [Prof. Minh Do](https://minhdo.ece.illinois.edu/)

I proposed a solution to use reinforcement learning to refine cranial implant designs for varied real-world cases.

## Light weight Visual SLAM for autonomous vehicles based on GraphSLAM and Deep Learning 
PI: [Dr. Xuan-Ha Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FO_xu-8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)

I proposed a new SLAM system that use an object detection model and a stereo depth estimation model for the frontend process. GraphSLAM was used to avoid redundancy and loop-closing. The solution is expected to improve the frontend process in both accuracy and computational effiency.

AIR-HUST is an autonomous intelligent service mobile robot developed by the Autonomous Intelligent Robotics Lab at HUST. I was the leader of the undergraduates in this project. The robot uses computer vision deep learning models for fire warning and medical object detection.

PI: [Dr. Xuan-Ha Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FO_xu-8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Assoc. Prof. Chan-Hung Nguyen](https://vn.linkedin.com/in/hung-nguyen-chan-62027621)

CBot is an intelligent service mobile robot based on Turtlebot2 at CMC Corporation. I developed the software system of the robot. In this project, I also did research on 2D SLAM for indoor robots.
