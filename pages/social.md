I participated in the [Temasek Foundation International Specialistsâ€™ Community Action and Leadership Exchange](https://www.facebook.com/TFISCALE.HUST/) (TFI SCALE) program between **Temasek Polytechnic** (TP) and **Hanoi University of Science and Technology**. The TFI SCALE programme provides a platform for youth from various institutions of higher learning in Southeast Asia to engage in holistic learning and cross-cultural sharing experience. Student Leaders from the region will spend 3 weeks in Singapore hosted by TP student leaders. Following this, TP student leaders will be attached to one of the regional institutions of higher learning for a period of two weeks. Here, TP student leaders will join their regional counterparts to implement their co-developed social innovation projects to benefit local communities. This includes projects that affect regional economic and community issues, with opportunities to apply practical skills, technology and research in developing social innovation projects.
